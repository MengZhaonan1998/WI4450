### Homework 1: Conjugate Gradient Method

In this exercise, we will exploit **shared memory parallelism** to solve
a standard partial differential equation, the 3D Poisson equation:

```latex
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + 
\frac{\partial^ u2}{\partial y^2} + 
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2} + 
= f(x,y,z),
```
on a unit cube, subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions
... etc
